# Real-Time AWS Cost Monitoring Dashboard

This project focuses on **AWS cost visibility from an operations perspective**.

Rather than FinOps theory, it demonstrates how engineers can:
- Monitor usage trends
- Identify unexpected spend
- React before costs escalate

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Pulling AWS cost and usage data
- Visualizing trends for operational awareness
- Supporting cloud cost conversations with data

## Services & Tools
- AWS Cost Explorer
- AWS APIs
- Python
- Dashboard / visualization components

## Ops Use Case
Cloud Operations teams are often the first to notice:
- Unexpected spikes in usage
- Resources left running
- Misconfigured services

This project shows how to surface that information clearly.

## Why This Matters
Many Cloud Ops roles require engineers to:
- Be cost-aware
- Identify waste
- Support remediation efforts

This project reflects that responsibility.

## How to Use
- Review the scripts and data flow
- Understand how cost data is retrieved
- Adapt the logic for alerts or reporting

## Audience
This project is aimed at:
- Cloud Operations
- Infrastructure Support
- Platform teams supporting AWS environments
